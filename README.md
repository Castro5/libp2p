**lib**p2p is a modular networking framework bundled together as a full stack of protocols for peer-to-peer systems.

**lib**p2p is the product of a long and arduous quest into the internet's network stack and all of the plentiful 
peer-to-peer protocols of the past. Building large-scale peer-to-peer systems has been complex and challenging 
in the last fifteen years, and **lib**p2p is a way to fix that. It is a "network stack" -- a protocol suite -- that 
cleanly separates concerns and enables sophisticated applications to only use the protocols they need without 
giving up interoperability and upgradeability. **lib**p2p grew out of IPFS but is built so that many people can use 
it for many different projects.
